# TED Talk Regression Project

## Project Overview

The TED Talk Regression project is an exploration of TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design) talk data to understand the factors that contribute to the popularity of talks. TED is a renowned organization dedicated to spreading powerful ideas across various domains. This project focuses on analyzing TED talk data to uncover insights using regression analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a collection of 4,000+ TED talks, including transcripts in multiple languages. These talks cover a wide range of topics and have been delivered by speakers from diverse backgrounds. The dataset provides various features for each talk, such as the title, speaker's name, number of views, duration, and more. The goal of this project is to analyze these features and identify patterns that contribute to the popularity of TED talks.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **data:** This directory contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- **ted_talk_regression.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the main project code. It encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, regression analysis, and visualization of results.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/padhilipika/ted_talk_regression.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook:**
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `ted_talk_regression.ipynb` file. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis, visualizations, and results.

## Results

By analyzing the TED talk dataset and performing regression analysis, this project aims to uncover insights into what factors contribute to the popularity of TED talks. Potential outcomes of this analysis include:

- Identification of key features (such as topic, duration, speaker occupation, etc.) that correlate with higher view counts.
- Creation of predictive models to estimate the expected number of views for a given set of talk attributes.
- Insights into the evolution of TED talks over time and the changing interests of the audience.

The project's code and visualizations will provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and the factors that drive the popularity of TED talks.
